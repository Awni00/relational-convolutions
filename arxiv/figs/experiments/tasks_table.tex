    Task              & Description                                                                                                                                                                                             \\ \midrule
    \texttt{same}              & Two random cells out of nine are occupied by an object. They are the ``same'' if they have the same color, shape, and orientation (i.e., identical image)                                               \\\hline
    \texttt{occurs}            & The top row contains one object and the bottom row contains three objects. The ``occurs'' relationship holds if at least one of the objects in the bottom row is the same as the object in the top row. \\\hline
    \texttt{xoccurs}           & Same as occurs, but the relationship holds if exactly one of the objects in the bottom row is the same as the object in the top row.                                                                    \\\hline
    \texttt{between}           & The grid is occupied by three objects in a line (horizontal or vertical). The ``between'' relationship holds if the outer objects are the same.                                                         \\\hline
    \texttt{row match pattern} & The first and third rows of the grid are occupied by three objects each. The ``match pattern'' relationship holds if the relation pattern in each row is the same (e.g., AAA, AAB, ABC, etc.)           \\ \bottomrule
