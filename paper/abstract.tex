    A new architecture is proposed for extracting hierarchical relational features for machine learning. Beginning with embeddings of objects, a multi-head relation module takes a sequence of embedded objects as input and produces a tensor that represents the relations between each pair of objects. A relational convolution layer then transforms the relation tensor into a sequence of new objects, each describing the relations within some group of objects at the previous layer. The relational convolutions are implemented using graphlet transforms and soft grouping operations. We present the motivation and details of the architecture, together with a series of experiments on relational games to demonstrate how relational convolutional neural networks can provide an effective framework for modeling relational tasks that have hierarchical structure.
