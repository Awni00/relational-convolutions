    A modeling framework is proposed for relational learning 
    that provides a natural, expressive architecture for extracting hierarchical relational features. Beginning with embeddings of objects, a multi-head relation module takes a sequence of embedded objects as input and produces a tensor that represents the relations between each pair of objects. The relational convolution layer then transforms the relation tensor into a sequence of new objects, each describing the relations within some group of objects at the previous layer. 
    A series of experiments is presented showing how relational convolutional neural networks provide an effective framework for relational learning.
