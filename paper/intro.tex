\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Modeling of relations between objects is important to a range of machine learning problems. For instance, an image analysis application might rely on comparing objects in terms of relations that extract color, size, or texture features; a natural language task may use relations that are based on syntactic or semantic features of pairs of words. To enable efficient learning of relational information, it is important to explore learning architectures that support processing of relations in a natural, expressive, and efficient manner. In this paper we propose a framework we call ``relational convolutional networks.'' Our framework provides for relational representation learning what standard convolutional neural networks provide for typical image processing applications---a natural, expressive architecture for extracting hierarchical features of the raw data that can be used for building flexible prediction algorithms.

A schematic of the proposed architecture to support hierarchical relational learning is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:relconv_architecture}. Beginning with embeddings of objects, an inner product relation module models the pairwise relations between objects and produces a relation tensor. The relational convolution layer then transforms the relation tensor into a sequence of new objects, each describing the relations within some group of objects at the previous layer.  An important component of the architecture is to use ``graphlets'' to carry out the relational convolution operation over groupings of the objects. Analogous to filters in CNNs, graphlet filters form a template of relations between subsets of objects against which the relation tensor is compared at each grouping. The next layer receives this sequence of new objects as input and again models the relations within it. Thus, each layer computes relational features of a higher order---that is, relations on relations. This is analogous to the manner in which convolutional layers in a CNN can be composed to construct a chain of feature maps.

In a series of experiments, we show how relational convolutional neural networks provides an effective framework (and inductive bias) for relational learning. We first carry out experiments on ``relational games" proposed as a benchmark for relational reasoning by~\citep{shanahanExplicitlyRelationalNeural}. This consists of a suite of binary classification tasks for identifying abstract relational rules between a set of objects represented as images. We next carry out experiments on a version of the SET game, which requires processing of  higher-order relations between multiple attributes on a set of cards. For both tasks, relational convolutional networks are able to achieve more sample efficient learning compared to Transformers, as well as other architecture that have been specifically developed for relational learning.
