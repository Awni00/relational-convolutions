Dear Action Editor & Reviewers,

Thank you for your thoughtful comments and feedback. We have uploaded the revised camera-ready version of the paper, incorporating several additions to address the reviewers' comments. Below is a summary of the main additions and changes made since the initial submission:

- **Entropy Regularization in Group Attention:** We conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of entropy regularization on training dynamics and model performance. [In response to Reviewer XLHi's question]
- **Ablations, symmetry, multi-dimensionality:** We included additional experiments evaluating the effect of symmetry and multi-dimensionality of relations in the RelConvNet architecture. [To address questions by Reviewer p6Dm]
- **CNN Baseline:** A CNN baseline was added to all experiments. [As suggested by Reviewer XLHi]
- **Hyperparameter sweeps for each baseline:** Carried out individual hyperparameter sweep over both architectural and optimization hyperparameters for each baseline, ensuring comparison against "best-in-class" performance. [To address concerns raised by Reviewer gD6M]

A more detailed discussion of these changes is provided in the global response and in our responses to individual reviewers.

Thank you again for your thoughtful feedback.
